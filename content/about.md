**Hello! I'm Mikee.**
\
\
I am a Software Engineer at Accenture in London, where I get to build products with all kinds of clients! I have built software for clients from various industries including retail, healthcare, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), start-ups and tech giants. I enjoy developing things, problem solving, planning, roadmapping and working with people... it's the little things you learn along the way that makes it worth the while!
\
\
Other than this, I also have a background in data science and academic research. I am detail-oriented, curious and a problem-solver by nature. I loved the idea of working on something that you're passionate about, but I soon realized that I had a lot more to learn about the world... so here I am! Despite being knee-deep in the corporate world, I am keen to continue evolving (as the world does) and am open-minded to new opportunities.

Work aside, I like reading, playing sports and the colour yellow (if you couldn't already tell). I also love to hang out with my **[cat ðŸ˜¾](/cat/)** in my free time.
