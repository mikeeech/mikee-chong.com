### **Hi there, I'm Mikee!**

\
I'm software developer in her 20's, currently based in London, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. I'm a **[Software Engineer at Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/about/technology-index)**, a tech consulting company, where I use code to help businesses solve problems and drive technological advancement.
\
\
I am a generalistâ€”an adaptable software engineer with experience developing in high pressure environments and adapting to changing project needs. I have experience developing full-stack and data applications across a range of use cases, and have shipped multiple greenfield projects from inception to production. My work philosophy is centered around transparency, communication and impact - I like to understand the bigger picture before coming up with a solution, I like to work with people, and I'm not not afraid to challenge norms, or take on new challenges as needed.

**_Other things about me_**

Before this, I was in academic research, where I contributed to topics like public health, genetics, and immunology. In my free time, I develop **[CircleBe](https://www.circlebe.com/)**, a platform for connecting experts around the world. I am trilingual and am fluent in English, Cantonese and Mandarin. I was born in Hong Kong and spent most of my years there until university, when I moved to London.
