### **From science to software: my journey so far**

\
I grew up with a passion for science and naturally went down the academic path, contributing my early career to various fields in medical research such as immunogenetics, aging and public health. But it wasn't until I started working with big data in public health research that I learnt more about the innovative and fast-paced nature of the tech industry. This soon captivated my interest and led to my decision of transitioning to the tech industry after 3 years in academia.

Currently, I am a **[Software Engineer at Accenture Technology](https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/about/technology-index)**, the tech arm of a global technology consulting firm that focuses on the development of innovative solutions to solve business challenges. I have had the plesaure of working with clients across tech, retail and healthcare, helping them adopt cutting-edge technologies like AI, machine learning, and cloud computing. I’ve led and contributed to a number of engineering projects, and successfully shipped multiple products from start to finish.
