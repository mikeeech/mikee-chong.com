### **My journey from science to software**

\
Growing up, I was deeply passionate about science, and this naturally led me to scientific research. I started a PhD and worked on a range of topics like immunogenetics, aging, and public health. But it wasn't until I started working as a data analyst that I gained interest in the tech industry. After 3 years, I left academia to become a software engineer at Accenture.
\
\
Currently, I am a **[Software Engineer at Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/about/technology-index)** - specifically the division that provides consultancy services through implementation-driven technology projects. I have had the plesaure of working with clients across tech, retail and healthcare, helping them build innovative ideas and solutions using modern technologies like AI, machine learning, and cloud computing. Iâ€™ve also contributed to a number of engineering projects, and successfully shipped multiple products from start to finish.

\
In my free time, I'm either working on new **[projects](/projects)** or developing **[CircleBe](https://www.circlebe.com/)**. I'm also an avid reader with particular interest in science and technology!
\
\
I'm most passionate about the people-oriented and cross-disciplinary aspects of software engineering and am always seeking new ways to innovate and help others through software.
