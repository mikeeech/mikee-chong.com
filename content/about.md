### **My journey from science to software**

\
Growing up, I always had a passion for science, which naturally led me down the academic path. I pursued (and discontinued) a PhD and worked in a number of medical research fields like immunogenetics, aging, and public health. But it wasn't until I started working with big data that I decided that I wanted to work in the tech industry. After 3 years, I left academia to become a software engineer at Accenture!
\
\
Since 2022, I've been a **[Software Engineer at Accenture Technology](https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/about/technology-index)**, the division of Accenture that develops software to help organizations solve business challenges. I've had the plesaure of working with clients across tech, retail and healthcare, helping them build innovative ideas and solve problems using modern technologies like AI, machine learning, and cloud computing. Iâ€™ve also led and contributed to a number of engineering projects, and successfully shipped multiple products from start to finish.
\
\
In my free time, I'm either working on new **[projects](/projects)** or developing **[CircleBe](https://www.circlebe.com/)**. I'm also an avid reader with particular interest in science and technology!
\
\
I'm most passionate about the people-oriented and cross-disciplinary aspects of software engineering and am always seeking new ways to innovate and help others through software.
