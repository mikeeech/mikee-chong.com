### **Hi there, I'm Mikee.**

\
I am a **[Software Engineer at Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/about/technology-index)**, helping companies navigate the evolving technology landscape by building, maintaining and re-architecting software. Before this, I was in academia and have contributed to research in public health, genetics and immunology. I love science and I love learning new things. Technology excites me because of its endless opportunities to explore and contribute to meaningful work.
\
\
In my free time, I develop **[CircleBe](https://www.circlebe.com/)**. I'm also working on a **[recipe journal](#)** (hopefully a book one day?) alongside other little hobbies of mine.
\
\
I'm always seeking ways to innovate and make a positive impact through software. If you'd like to connect or work together, feel free to reach out on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeechong/)** or message me **[here](/contact)**!
