### **Hi there, I'm Mikee!**

\
I'm a software engineer in her 20's based in London, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.
\
\
I'm currently a **[Software Engineer at Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/about/technology-index)**, a tech consulting company, where I build software to help businesses solve problems. I work with all kinds of clients and use cases, which means I have broad experience in software, but am not an expert in any one domain. I am, however, an adaptable developer who is able to quickly pick up new technologies and languages (mostly by asking lots of questions and being quite diligent). So far, I've built mostly greenfield projects, contributing from ideation to production, and mostly full-stack and data applications. I also have an interest in emerging technologies such as machine learning and AI.

**_Other things about me_**
\
I have an unconventional career background, having started in academia doing biomedical research, which led me to epidemiology and data science. This inspired me to enter the tech industry for a more stable and less restrictive career path. I was inspired by a lot of the mentors I worked with in my early career and I now aspire to be a tech lead! In my free time, I develop **[CircleBe](https://www.circlebe.com/)**, a platform for connecting experts around the world. I am trilingual and am fluent in English, Cantonese and Mandarin. I was born in Hong Kong and spent most of my years there until university, when I moved to London.
