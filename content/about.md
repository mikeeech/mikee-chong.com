**Hello! I'm Mikee.**
\

I am a Software Engineer in London who has spent the past 5 years working in the intersection of science, data and software engineering. Currently at Accenture, I have built software for clients from various industries including retail, healthcare, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), start-ups and tech giants... and more! I enjoy developing things, problem solving, planning, roadmapping and working with people... it's the little things you learn along the way that makes it worth the while!

Other than this, I also have a background in data science and academic research. I am detail-oriented, curious and a problem-solver by nature. I loved the idea of working on something that you're passionate about, but I soon realized that I had a lot more to learn about the world... so here I am! Despite being knee-deep in the corporate world, I am keen to continue learning and evolving (as the world does) and am open-minded to new opportunities.

Work aside, I like reading, running and the colour yellow (if you couldn't already tell). I also enjoy spending time with my **[cat 😾](/cat/)** in my free time.
