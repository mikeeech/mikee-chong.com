**Hello! I'm a software engineer based in London.**
\
\
Currently at Accenture, I develop software for clients across industries â€” retail, healthcare, start-ups and tech. I have worked on multiple greenfield projects, with distributed systems and data pipelines. Before this, I was a data scientist and academic researcher.
\
\
In my free time, I'm either building up my portfolio of **[projects](/projects)** or developing the MVP of **[CircleBe](https://www.circlebe.com/)**.
\
\
Outside of work, a few passions of mine include reading, running, painting and anything yellow (as you may have noticed). I also enjoy spending time with my **[cats ðŸ˜¾](/cats)** in my free time!
