### **Lover of science, research, design and problem-solving... currently developing software in London.**
\
Growing up, I always had a fire in me to make a positive difference in the world. However, adulthood hit hard when I realized that passion alone was not enough to create tangible impact, let alone have a sustainable career. But now, as a software engineer, I relish the opportunity to work with people and solve problems everyday for a living.
\
\
I believe software should be created for people (human-centered engineering/human-centered design). After all, we are the ones operating and experiencing this new *digital universe* that we are building and creating everyday! While I love software development, I consider myself to be a multi-disciplinary techie - I also love to lead, coach, build communities, design, learn and develop!
\
\
After spending 2 years as a PhD student and data scientist respectively, I am now a software developer at Accenture - a technology consultancy. Here, I work with clients to build software across industries, including retail, healthcare, start-ups and tech. I have worked on multiple greenfield projects, and have re-architected and refined old systems. Most importantly, my work revolves around ensuring quality and user-centricity with everything that we build!

In my free time, I'm either building up some **[projects](/projects)** or developing **[CircleBe](https://www.circlebe.com/)**.
