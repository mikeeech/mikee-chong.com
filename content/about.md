Hello! I'm Mikee.
\
\
I'm a Software Engineer at Accenture in London, where I get to build products with all kinds of clients. I have built software for several industries including retail, healthcare, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and start-ups, although you may not find all this information within my CV as there would be too much to mention. I enjoy the developing things, problem solving, planning, roadmapping... it's the little things you learn along the way that makes it worth the while!

Other than this, I also have a background in data science and academic research. I am detail-oriented, curious and a problem-solver by nature. I loved the idea of working on something that you're passionate about, but I soon realized that I had a lot more to learn about the world... so here I am! Despite being knee-deep in the corporate world, I am still a huge advocate of PhDs and would be open-minded to it if I find a topic that I truly believe in.

Work aside, I like science, sports, tech, and the colour yellow (if you couldn't already tell). I also love to hang out with my **[cat ðŸ˜¾](/cat/)** in my free time.
