### **From science to software: my journey so far**

\
Growing up, I always had a passion for science, which naturally led me down the academic path. I spent the early years of my career working on medical research across fields like immunogenetics, aging, and public health. But it wasn't until I started working with big data in public health research that I learnt more about the innovative and fast-paced nature of the tech industry. Almost immediately, this captivated my interest and led to my transition to the tech industry after 3 years in academia.
\
\
Currently, I am a **[Software Engineer at Accenture Technology](https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/about/technology-index)**, the division of Accenture that develops software to solve business challenges. I've had the plesaure of working with clients across tech, retail and healthcare, helping them solve problems using cutting-edge technologies like AI, machine learning, and cloud computing. Iâ€™ve also led and contributed to a number of engineering projects, and successfully shipped multiple products from start to finish.

In my free time, I'm either working on new **[projects](/projects)** or developing **[CircleBe](https://www.circlebe.com/)**. I'm also an avid reader with particular interest in science and technology!
\
\
I'm most passionate about the people-oriented and cross-disciplinary aspects of software engineering and am always seeking new ways to learn and help others through software.
